* CCS2
** use sidechain to replace shake
shake algorithm can't deal with the complex sidechain

** implement another R6 algorithm provide by Sha Yao

** autodetect the logic symmetry of molecule
and a general method to deal with symmetry relation functions.

** support all-kinds of peptide.

* Molecule
** clean Molecule class
keep Molecule class small and clean, remove other methods to
src/Molecule/tools.py.

** full-implement RMSD
now rmsd.py doesn't consider translation and rotation

** support more file formats

Tinker int

** support auto-detection of file format

* Tinker
